 <h1>vehicle features take center stage(1930 todate)</h1>
 <p1>Along with mass production came new features, some of the first being speedometers,
     seatbelts, windshields and rearview mirrors. Believe it or not, the first turn signals
    weren’t added to a car until Buick did it in 1939 – that’s even after the first car with
     electric windows and air conditioning! Then cars started to get fancy, with power steering (1951), 
     cruise control (1957), three-point seatbelts (1959) and heated seats (1966).
 In 1973, Oldsmobile installed the first passenger airbag into their “Tornado” model.
     Over 20 years later in 1998, the federal government required all passenger vehicles to come standard
      with dual frontal airbags.
    In the late 80’s and early 90’s keyless entry systems, electric doors and windows, sunroofs and
     CD players began to be standard features. This is about the time when technology became a big selling
      point.
