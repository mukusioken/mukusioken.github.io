<h1>Modern vehicle features</h1>
<p1>This brings us to modern-day cars with Bluetooth, hard drives, advanced safety systems,
   GPS, WiFi and even the ability to parallel park themselves. It seems crazy, but it’s true.
    In this age, cars come standard with features
   that were once a luxury (or didn’t even exist at all). And driverless cars that once seemed 
   like something out of a science fiction film are close to being a reality. It’s amazing to think 
   how far cars have come and where the technology will go down the road.
With technology advancing, it's more important than ever to keep up with on-road driving techniques
to keep those around you safe at all times. Check out our defensive driving course for more
information on how to learn the latest best practices online.</p1> 
<h2>Advantages & disadvantages of vehicles</h2>
<p2style=<color:cyan></color:cyan><li>The cars are very useful & helpful to the human in the life, They can 
transport the people to important places such as the work, the hospitals & 
the schools, but they can also pollute & ruin the environment and they can 
affect on the human health.</li>
<br>
The cars can transport the people & goods from one part of the country to the
 other easily, The people would be very tired from walking long distances if there
  were no cars, The cars help the people to go to other places quicker, The cars help
the people to travel around with a great deal of freedom, They can be also used for the
 luxury and the entertainment.
Just like everything that has advantages,vehicles  also have their disadvantages
 because an accident is inevitible ,the operation cost 
of fuel consumption and many more including;Tiring,Cramped Conditions,Bad for Environment,Breakdowns
 and Accidents,Boredom,Bad Weather,Hidden Costs/Wear and Tear
Finding Parking,Wasted Time and Slow </p2>
The invention of the automobile has had a profound impact on our lives, culture,
 and environment in many ways 
 <br>
 1. Cars gave people more personal freedom and access 
 to jobs and services, leading to the development of better roads and transportation. 
 The mass production of cars, pioneered by Henry Ford’s Model T and factory assembly line,
  revolutionized modern life and influenced labor practices, civil rights, cities, the arts, 
  social life, and the environment 
  <br>
  2. The automobile industry also created new jobs and industries
   to supply the demand for automobile parts and fuel, including petroleum,
 gasoline, rubber, and plastics 1.
The automobile has been a driving force behind the growth in the oil and gas industry, and today,
 over 4.25 million people work directly within the automotive industry
 <br>
  3. However, the negative effects 
 of the car on everyday life are significant, despite the positive effects on access to remote
  places and mobility, comfort provided by the automobile, allowing people to geographically
   increase their social and economic interactions.
<br>
 4.In summary, the automobile has transformed our lives in many ways, both positive and 
negative, and has influenced the economy, labor practices, civil rights, cities, the arts, social life,
and the environment 1456.What are some negative effects of the automobile?
How did cars influence labor practices and civil rights?
What is the future of automobiles
<h2>The future of automobiles</h2>
Though diesel vehicles have a better fuel economy cruising at high speeds, the emissions are
 worse compared to the emissions from gasoline engines. Besides the advance of the current internal
  combustion engine technology, concerns of how best to reduce fossil fuel usage and utilise renewable 
  energies are becoming increasingly important. This is where the hybrid vehicle shines. The call to fame
   of the hybrid system is being independent of any type of power train. In theory, a hybrid vehicle is one
    that uses any combination of liquid, gas, and electricity, bio fuels, hydrogen, and electricity. 
    The true benefits of hybrid vehicles can be understood that hybrid use is a bridging system.
     An electrical power boosting platform to be applied together with a powertrain from an internal
      combustion engine. This reduces the environmental impact because of the hybrid fuel source. 
      In this context, hybrid technology is proposed as a broad platform to introduce new powertrain systems.
       Moreover, advances in alternative energy supply will make these new systems gradually available to 
       the mass market. Through similar thinking, such developments will undergo significant technological
        progress across a wide field of science. Engineers at Toyota are committed to teamwork with all
         interested parties in order to achieve a better future.
         In 2016 there was a significant movement toward the mainstreaming of electric vehicles with
          improved battery technology, tougher emissions standards, and the demand for clean technology.
           The growth has been steady, but slower than supporters of the technology would like to see.
            All-electric vehicles (EVs), also referred to as battery electric vehicles, have an electric
             motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery 
             pack to power the electric motors and must be plugged into a wall outlet or charging equipment,
              also called electric vehicle supply equipment. The vehicle does not release any exhaust from
               a tailpipe and does not contain the typical liquid fuel components, such as a fuel pump,
                fuel line, or fuel tank because it runs on electricity. All-electric vehicles use a battery
                 pack to store the electrical energy that powers the motor. EV batteries are charged by 
                 plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. Although electricity production may
                  contribute to air pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency categorizes
                   all-electric vehicles as zero-emission vehicles because they do not directly 
                   produce exhaust or tailpipe emissions. Today’s EVs generally have a shorter
                    driving range per charge compared to conventional vehicles per tank of gas. However,
                     the increasing range of new models and the continued development
 of high-powered charging equipment is reducing this gap. The efficiency and
driving range of EVs vary substantially based on driving conditions.Extreme outside temperatures tend 
to reduce range because more energy
 must be used to heat or cool the cabin. EVs are more efficient in city driving conditions than highway
  travel. City driving conditions have more frequent stops, which maximize the benefits of regenerative
   braking.
Self-driving vehicles are automobiles that require limited human intervention. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars. They combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle. Currently, there are no legally operating, fully-autonomous vehicles in the United States. However, there are partially-autonomous vehicles currently for sale. Though still in its early stages of development, self-driving technology is becoming increasingly common and could drastically transform our transportation as we know it. Different cars are capable of different levels of self-driving and are often described by researchers on a scale of 0-5. Level 0 is where all major systems are controlled by humans. Level 1 is where only certain systems such as cruise control or automatic braking may be controlled by the car one at a time. Level 2 is where the car offers at least two simultaneous automated functions such as acceleration and steering, but requires humans for safe operation. Level 3 is where the car can manage all safety-critical functions under certain conditions, but the driver is expected to take over when alerted. Level 4 is where the car is fully-autonomous in some driving scenarios but not all. Level 5 is where the car is completely capable of self-driving in every situation. Currently the Tesla brand produces level 2 autonomous cars which are basically a step ahead adaptive cruise control
